This FastAPI application handles authentication using JWT and provides two secured endpoints. It includes a login route (/login) where users can authenticate with a username and password to receive a JWT token. The token is stored in cookies and used to access protected routes like /welcome, which returns a personalized greeting, and /transactions, which provides a list of predefined transactions. The app uses CORS middleware to allow cross-origin requests and applies OAuth2 password flow for authentication. The JWT tokens are validated before granting access to the secured routes.
